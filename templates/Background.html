      In what follows we ask you to play two games. The games involve you betting on a simulated coinflip. <br><br>
      You will receive Â£20 at the start of each game to play with. We refer to this amount as your <b>capital.</b> The aim of both games
      is to earn as much capital as possible. <br><br>
      One of the games requires you to bet all of your capital during each round. In this game you are free to bet on both sides
      of the coin. In other words, you can split your capital between the two outcomes (heads and tails) in whatever way you like. <br><br>
      The other game requires you to only bet on one side of the coin (heads or tails). In this game you are not required to bet
      all of your capital during each round, however you are free to do so if wanted.<br><br>
      You will play 60 rounds of each game, meaning you will play a total of 120 rounds.
